<p> The purpose of this data analysis project is looking at the data set which has been taken from <b> Kaggle </b> entitled  <b>Summer Olympics Medals</b> evaluated from  <b> 1976 to 2008</b>  to answer some questions using <b> Microsoft Power BI </b>. Additionally, to look at specific results, on the left hand side for each page, there are some tools that can help to list values. </p>
